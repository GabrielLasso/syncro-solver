# Syncro
Syncro is a game developed by MathGurl and her friends, as explained [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxNCUQaES3Y&ab_channel=MathGurl). This software was used to find the solution for level 20 using 15 moves.

# Dependencies
The only dependency for compiling this is Nim. I used Nim v1.4.2, but any version above 1.0 should work

# Addind other levels.
The level 20 graph is defined in the `initializeLevel20` proc. You can define other graphs by adding more cells and changind the adjacency lists to find solutions for other levels.

It is guaranteed that the solution found has minimum lenght.
